# Visualization - Sorting
A small repository for seeing sorting algorithms 
in action. Click the randomize button to generate a new random array and click the sort button to watch the sorting algorithm do its magic!

Currently viewable on the gitub pages for this project [here.](https://johnthenkel.github.io/Visualization-Sorting/) Check out my github pages profile [here](https://johnthenkel.github.io/) and other projects I've worked on [here.](https://github.com/JohnTHenkel)

### Currently Implemented
* Array Randomization
* Array Sorting
    * Bubble Sort
* Basic visualization
    * Currently compared elements are highlighted
### Future Plans
* Additional Sorting Algorithms
* User-alterable sorting speed and array size
